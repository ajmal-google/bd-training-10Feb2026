# Wesfarmers BD Slide Style Guide (Demo Extract)

Use this benchmark for comments and speaker notes.

## Tone discipline
- Use understated language and avoid hype terms.
- Prefer "satisfactory returns" as the return framing unless formally approved otherwise.
- Avoid words like "game-changing", "transformative", "disrupt", "incredible", "explosive", "massive", and "outstanding".

## Numeric integrity
- Use one authoritative figure for each KPI across all slides.
- Reconcile all calculations shown in the deck (for example EBITDA, Capex, and FCF bridges).
- Resolve any same-slide contradictions before circulation.
- Keep synergy ranges and target values consistent between summary and detail slides.

## Logical validity
- Ensure benchmark statements are directionally correct versus national or market baselines.
- Keep chart component totals aligned with headline percentages.
- If a claim is framed as strength, show why it is above the reference benchmark.

## Narrative structure
- Build the strategic and growth case before valuation.
- Present valuation only after thesis, roadmap, and risk controls are clear.
- Keep one commercial message per slide.

## Consistency and operating detail
- Ensure footprint totals reconcile with state or segment splits.
- Make targets proportionate to the addressable base and explain deliberate under-targeting.
- Keep labels, units, timeframes, and terminology consistent throughout.

## Precedent and history
- Cite major internal precedents that materially affect credibility (for example Catch wind-down).
- Anchor local comps before international comps and state comparability caveats explicitly.
- Include lessons learned from prior losses (for example Homebase) when proposing expansion pilots.

## Speaker notes standard
- Do not repeat slide text verbatim.
- Explain what to say, why it matters, and what decision is needed.
- End with ask, owner, and follow-up timing.
